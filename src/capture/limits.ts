 * enforced on the body-auth edge of `POST /v1/episodic` — so every write
 * this plugin makes, passive or explicit, passes through it).
 *
 * A 422 is a terminal client error, so an oversized turn dead-letters: the
 * memory is lost. That is the right outcome for a corrupt row and the wrong
 * one for a long conversation, which is exactly the case this module exists
 * to handle before the payload ever reaches the wire.
 *
 * The limit is measured in BYTES, not characters. A naive `slice()` is a
 * character operation, so content that is mostly non-ASCII would still
 * exceed the ceiling after being "truncated" — a 32k-character slice of
 * Japanese text is ~96k bytes.
