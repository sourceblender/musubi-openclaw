    // rows are NULL — and a later startup, seeing the column, would skip a
    // backfill guarded by the branch above. Those rows then count as
    // `recentDead` forever (the `IS NULL` predicate in health()) and are
    // never pruned (the `IS NOT NULL` predicate in prune()), which is
    // precisely the latched-`degraded` failure this column was added to end.
    // Idempotent: once every dead row has a timestamp this matches nothing.
    // Stamped with an explicit "died before this upgrade, exact time unknown"
    // sentinel, dated a clear margin before the alert window opens (see
    // BACKFILL_DEATH_BACKDATE_MS). Two constraints have to
    // hold at once and each rules out the obvious answer to the other.
    //
    //   `Date.now()` fails the alarm constraint. A ledger upgraded from a
    //   version predating this column hands every historical dead row to the
    //   backfill at once, so dating them "now" puts deaths from weeks ago
    //   inside DEAD_ALERT_WINDOW_MS: the first `/musubi-status` after an
    //   upgrade reports `degraded` with the entire lifetime dead count under
    //   `dead_recent` — an alarm the upgrade invented, which is the class of
    //   un-actionable signal this column exists to end.
    //
    //   `created_at_ms` fails the retention constraint. It is only a LOWER
    //   bound on death, and the gap is unbounded: a delivery enqueued 40 days
    //   ago that retried for weeks and died yesterday would be stamped 40 days
    //   old and deleted by the very next prune(), destroying the post-mortem
    //   payload for a death that happened yesterday. Trading a false alarm for
    //   lost evidence is not a fix.
    //
    // The sentinel satisfies both: clear of the alert window, so it raises
    // nothing, and clear by a bounded amount — one extra window, see
    // BACKFILL_DEATH_BACKDATE_MS — so every backfilled row keeps
    // DEAD_RETENTION_MS minus two days of inspection from the upgrade.
