# Transport

The active first-class provider talks to a Musubi core over HTTP:

- **HTTP** for request/response work — retrieval queries, episodic captures,
  curated reads, thought send/check/history, health probes.
- **Server-Sent Events** were implemented by the historical provider but are
  not shipped in the first-class release because there is no verified OpenClaw
  context-delivery contract for received thoughts.

The clients share the same base URL and bearer token. A future gRPC streaming
transport is anticipated upstream; when it lands, this plugin will add it
behind the same configuration surface. Until then, everything below.

> The HTTP and SSE surfaces on the server are specified in the Musubi v2
> repo at `docs/architecture/07-interfaces/canonical-api.md`. That document
> is the source of truth. This page describes client behavior that mirrors
> its normative requirements.

## HTTP

### Base URL

Configured at `core.baseUrl`. All endpoints are rooted at `<baseUrl>/v1/…`.

### Authentication

Every request sends `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Tokens carry a
presence identity and namespace scopes — see
[Presence model](./presence-model.md) for the token-scoping rules.

### Headers

- `X-Request-Id` — the plugin generates one per outbound request so server
  logs and client logs share a correlation id.
- `Idempotency-Key` — on POSTs that write, the plugin generates a fresh
  key so retries don't double-write.

### Retries

Network errors and `5xx` responses are retried with exponential backoff.
`4xx` is not retried except `429 Too Many Requests` (honors `Retry-After`).

### Timeouts

Per-request timeout defaults to 30s, configurable via `core.requestTimeoutMs`.

## Inactive SSE reference: `/v1/thoughts/stream`

> Historical protocol reference, not current runtime state. Re-establish the
> active behavior with `rg -n "createThoughtStream|onThought" src/plugin`.
> The current provider registers no inbound stream.

The removed historical client subscribed to `/v1/thoughts/stream`. The
first-class provider ships no subscriber. This section preserves the protocol
for a future integration that can prove how received thoughts enter OpenClaw
context before it is admitted to the runtime.

### Request shape

```
GET /v1/thoughts/stream?namespace=<presence>&include=<filter>
Accept: text/event-stream
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Last-Event-ID: <optional — KSUID of last seen thought; triggers replay>
```

`namespace` is the configured presence. `include` defaults to
`<presence-slug>,all` (the two values that normally target a given
presence); operators may override.

### Event types the client handles

- **`event: thought`** — one per delivered thought. The SSE `id:` field is
  the thought's `object_id`, a 27-character base62 KSUID. The body is
  JSON with `object_id`, `from_presence`, `to_presence`, `namespace`,
  `content`, `channel`, `importance`, `sent_at`.
- **`event: ping`** — keepalive, every 30 seconds. No action beyond
  bumping the "last-frame-seen" timestamp.
- **`event: close`** — graceful shutdown signal with an optional
  `reconnect_after_ms`. Client waits the hinted delay then reconnects.

### Replay on reconnect

The client persists the most recent `id:` it has acknowledged and, on
reconnect, sends it back as the `Last-Event-ID` request header. Server
replays every thought in the subscription where `object_id > <ksuid>` in
lexicographic order before entering live-tail mode. Because KSUIDs sort by
time, this is a cheap range query.

**Comparison is lexicographic, not numeric.** `"2iVVRLuCj…" > "2iVVRLuAh…"`
is the correct ordering.

### Fanout is broadcast

Multiple simultaneous subscriptions to the same presence **each receive
every event**. If a user has two browsers open and a LiveKit worker all
subscribed to `eric/aoi`, all three see every thought addressed to Aoi.
This is normative in the upstream spec and the plugin depends on it — the
client never assumes it owns the stream for a presence.

### Backpressure

The server drops in-memory events for slow consumers. No data loss: the
thoughts are durable in Qdrant, and a reconnect with `Last-Event-ID`
recovers them. The client therefore must not rely on the stream alone for
append-ordering; it treats the stream as "eventually complete via replay."

### Connection cap

The server caps concurrent SSE streams per API process at 100 in v1.0.
Over-cap connections receive `503 Service Unavailable` with
`Retry-After: 5`. The client honors `Retry-After` and retries.

## Consumer expectations (client contract)

These were the contract the historical plugin subscriber implemented and
remain requirements for the LiveKit worker or any future consumer. They mirror the
"Consumer expectations" section of the upstream canonical-api spec
verbatim so behavior stays aligned across implementations.

1. **Exponential backoff with jitter on drop.**
   `delay_ms = min(2^n * 1000 + rand(0, 1000), 60_000)` where `n` starts
   at 0 and increments each failed attempt. Reset `n` to 0 after 5 minutes
   of stable connection. Upper bound is overridable via
   `thoughts.reconnect.maxBackoffMs`, but never below 60s without very
   good reason.
2. **Persist `Last-Event-ID` across restarts.** The plugin uses OpenClaw's
   plugin-scoped state store. Losing the ID replays the entire plane.
3. **Bounded local dedup set** of the last 1000 `object_id`s or a 1-hour
   TTL, whichever bound is hit first. Replay and in-flight frames can
   overlap during a reconnect; any `object_id` already in the set is
   skipped.
4. **Scope-mismatch handling.** `403 Forbidden` on the initial GET is a
   token-scope problem. Do **not** reconnect on 403 — that would hammer
   the server with calls that will never succeed. Bubble a user-visible
   "re-authenticate Musubi" status.
5. **Ping-gap timeout** of 60s (two ping intervals). If no frame of any
   kind arrives in that window, the connection is presumed dead; the
   client closes its side to trigger the normal reconnect path. Catches
   silent half-open TCPs behind VPNs and proxies.
6. **Lexicographic ID comparison** everywhere an `object_id` is compared
   (replay ordering, dedup-set insertion, persisted-id staleness checks).
   Never parse as an integer.

## Failure and degraded modes

- **Musubi core unreachable at startup.** The client enters the reconnect
  loop immediately. Read tools return typed errors; write operations remain
  in the durable outbox and provider status reports degradation. Prompt
  guidance remains synchronous and performs no remote I/O.
- **Token expired or scope revoked.** `401`/`403` surface a user-visible
  status. SSE stays disconnected; HTTP operations fail fast with a typed
  error.
- **Slow stream / backpressure.** Handled transparently by the server's
  drop + client's replay. No user-visible effect.
- **OpenClaw plugin host shutdown.** The client closes its SSE connection
  cleanly and persists the last `id:` seen so the next load resumes
  without loss.
