Entry point: `src/index.ts` delegates synchronously to
`registerMusubi(...)` in `src/plugin/bootstrap.ts`.
The deployment contract selects `plugins.slots.memory = "musubi"`.

## Registration

Registration is side-effect free but fail-closed:

1. TypeBox validates the materialized config.
2. Every token is checked for unresolved `${...}` syntax, including hyphenated
   placeholders that caused the 2026-08-07 incident.
3. One exclusive memory capability is registered.
4. Native and canonical Musubi tools are registered as per-agent factories.
5. The `agent_end` hook, host-owned service, gateway status method, slash
   command, and CLI status command are registered.

No promise catches registration failure. Invalid configuration reaches the
OpenClaw loader and cannot become a plugin reported as loaded but inert.

## Host-owned service

`registerService({ id: "musubi-memory" })` starts the process-wide delivery
authority:

- SQLite outbox at `<stateDir>/musubi/delivery-outbox.sqlite`;
- lease recovery and delivery worker;
- deterministic shutdown.

OpenClaw 2026.7.1 can evaluate the plugin once per embedded agent run while
starting services for only the gateway-owned registration. Consequently,
registration-local controllers are not a valid ownership boundary: an
`agent_end` handler may belong to a different registration from the service
that opened the outbox. Every `DeliveryController` therefore routes through a
`globalThis`-keyed process authority, and every registration contributes to one
process-wide content-free capture diagnostic. A newer service start supersedes
the prior owner; stopping that stale owner cannot close the replacement.

The process authority is a plugin-side compatibility boundary, not an assertion
that OpenClaw's per-run registration lifecycle is ideal. Regression coverage
must register the plugin twice, start the service once, dispatch through the
second registration, and require durable enqueue.

The old inbound thought SSE subscriber is not registered. Its handler did not
deliver received thoughts into OpenClaw context, so starting it would consume a
durable event without providing the advertised capability. Outbound
`musubi_think` remains a separate tool.

Discovery and validation modes see registration metadata without opening
sockets or databases. The full host service creates runtime state at start and
closes it at stop.

## Capture ordering

```text
translate whole turn
  -> resolve per-agent presence/token
  -> INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING
  -> SELECT row and verify identity binding
  -> return from agent_end
  -> background claim/lease
  -> receipt lookup when replaying
  -> POST /v1/episodic
  -> persist accepted object_id
  -> GET canonical object
  -> compare object_id + namespace + sha256(content)
  -> mark verified and prune plaintext payload
```

Crash boundaries are explicit: a committed pending row survives restart; an
accepted row never repeats POST; an orphaned lease returns to pending or
accepted based on whether `object_id` was persisted.

## Verification

Repository gates:

```bash
npm run build
npm test
```

On OpenClaw 2026.7.1, CLI bootstrap validates plugin config before the
`--allow-exec` prepared-secret snapshot is applied, so CLI preview contexts
(`plugins inspect`, `doctor`, plugin CLI commands) hand the plugin the
AUTHORED config with token fields still as `SecretRef` objects. As of 2.0.6
the plugin handles that context explicitly instead of erroring:

- A **legitimate** unresolved ref — exactly OpenClaw's contract,
  `{ source: "env" | "file" | "exec", provider, id }` — degrades to a single
  info line ("CLI preview … memory tools inactive in this process") and
  registers nothing. No `Expected string` error; the config is healthy and
  the gateway materializes it normally.
- A **malformed** ref (unknown `source`, missing or blank/whitespace-only
  `provider`/`id` — OpenClaw requires both to `trim()` non-empty — or extra
  properties) still fails registration loudly, like any other invalid
  config. Blank token *strings* are refused the same way. Malformed configuration must never present as a healthy loaded
  plugin with zero tools.
- `${...}` placeholder *strings* remain a hard refusal (the 1.0 house-wide
  401 root cause).

In a CLI preview the plugin therefore shows as loaded-but-inactive by
design; gateway startup diagnostics, `musubi.status`, and the receiving
Musubi API remain the authoritative installed-path proof. Do not replace
structured secret refs with plaintext or `${...}` strings to make the CLI
show active tools.

These commands are the operator surface (fully active in gateway context;
inactive-by-design in CLI preview until OpenClaw prepares secrets before CLI
plugin bootstrap):

```bash
openclaw plugins inspect musubi --runtime --json
openclaw musubi-status
openclaw musubi-doctor --agent vesper
```

The loader smoke creates an isolated OpenClaw state/config, selects Musubi in
the memory slot, loads the built package through the real 2026.7.1 runtime,
and verifies that the authored config is not mutated.

The doctor is the end-to-end runtime proof. It uses the provider's durable
outbox rather than bypassing it with a direct write, verifies canonical readback
and semantic retrieval, and soft-archives its diagnostic object afterward.
