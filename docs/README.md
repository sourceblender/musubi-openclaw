# Documentation

This folder is the authoritative design surface for `openclaw-musubi`.
Implementation slices trace back to these documents; when a doc and the code
disagree, we update one or the other in the same PR.

## Start here

- [Architecture overview](./architecture/overview.md) — current first-class
  provider topology, durability boundaries, and rerunnable proof.
- [Presence model](./architecture/presence-model.md) — how OpenClaw agents
  map to Musubi presences, how tokens are scoped.
- [Transport](./architecture/transport.md) — active HTTP behavior and the
  explicitly inactive historical SSE reference.

## Contracts

- [API consumer contract](./api-contract.md) — the behavior any Musubi-client
  must implement. Mirrors the consumer-expectations section of the upstream
  Musubi canonical-api spec so both sides build to the same doc.

## Decisions

See [`decisions/`](./decisions/) for Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).
Every load-bearing choice lands as an ADR so future contributors can
reconstruct **why** — not just what.
